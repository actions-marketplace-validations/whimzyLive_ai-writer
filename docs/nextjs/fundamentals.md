# Next.js Fundamentals

## Introduction

Next.js is a framework for building enterprise applications with React. It provides a number of features to improve development efficiency, performance, and scalability of React applications.

In this blog, we will discuss some of the key features of Next.js and their basics.

## Page

Next.js provides an easy-to-use routing system, based on the file system. It allows developers to create pages under the "pages" directory and map the URL to them automatically. For example, if we have a file named `about.js` under the `pages` directory, Next.js will automatically map the URL `/about` to this page.

## Link

Link component is provided by Next.js for client-side navigation. It automatically prefetches the content for the linked page and provides a smooth transition between pages. It works with server-side routing, ensuring that the page is rendered on the server before navigating to the client.

## Layout

Next.js provides the option for page-based and folder-based layout sharing. Developers can define a `layout.js` file that can be used as a wrapper around their pages. This can help to avoid code duplication and keep the layout code consistent across all pages.

## Fonts

Next.js can automatically host and serve fonts. Developers can load fonts from `@next/font/{google|local}` by simply importing them into their project.

## Style

Next.js provides a unique feature of scoping the styles to the nested page, allowing for more maintainable and modular code. This ensures that styles defined for one component do not affect the styles of other components.

## Global Style

Global styles are required to be imported into the global layout file. This ensures that they are included on every page and do not cause problems when switching between pages.

## Image

Next.js provides a built-in size optimization feature, along with visual stability. It automatically optimizes the images to reduce their size and improve performance.

## Static Data Fetching

Static site generation is used to generate pages at build time, allowing for faster load times and better SEO performance. Next.js includes a default fetch API that caches the response for static data fetching.

## Dynamic Data Fetching

Next.js provides an option for dynamic data fetching with the "cache - no-store" option on the fetch API. This ensures that the data is always fresh and does not cause any performance issues.

## Examples

Here are a few examples that illustrate how these features work:

### Page

```
import React from 'react';

const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
```

### Link

```
import Link from 'next/link';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

### Layout

```
import Layout from '../components/layout';

const Index = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Index;
```

### Fonts

```
import '../styles/global.css';
import '@next/font/local.css';

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
};

export default MyApp;
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a number of features that can help to improve the development efficiency, performance, and scalability of React applications. By leveraging the above mentioned features, you can create enterprise-level applications with ease. So, what are you waiting for? Start exploring Next.js today!
