Next.JS is a popular framework for building enterprise applications with React. It is widely used by developers because of its simplicity and ease of use. In this blog, we'll explore the fundamentals of Next.JS and how it can be used to build powerful applications.

### Page

One of the most important concepts in Next.JS is the Page. It is used for basic routing and is defined by a file in the pages directory. For example, if we create a file called index.js in the pages directory, it will be used to create a page at the root of our application. Similarly, if we create a file called about.js, a page will be created at "/about".

### Link

Another important concept in Next.JS is the Link. It is used to auto prefetch content and provide client-side navigation with server-side routing. Links can be created using the Link component provided by Next.JS. Here's an example of how to use Link:

```
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>About</a>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

### Layout

In Next.JS, Layout is used for page and folder-based layout sharing. It can be defined by a file in the pages directory with the name `_app.js`. Here's an example of how to use Layout:

```
import Layout from '../components/layout';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

### Fonts

Next.JS automatically hosts and serves fonts. Fonts can be loaded from `@next/font/{google|local}`. Here's an example of how to use Fonts:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/_next/static/css/font-google.css" />
```

### Style

Next.JS scopes the styles to the nested page. It can be defined by a file in the pages directory with the name `_document.js`. Here's an example of how to use Style:

```
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <style>{`
            body {
              background: #f0f0f0;
            }
          `}</style>
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

### Global Style

Global style needs to be imported to the global layout file. Here's an example of how to use Global Style:

```
import '../styles/global.css';
```

### Image

Next.JS provides built-in size optimization and visual stability for images. It can be used by importing the `Image` component from `next/image`. Here's an example of how to use Image:

```
import Image from 'next/image';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/images/my-image.jpg"
      alt="My Image"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  );
}
```

### Static Data Fetching

Next.JS is used for static site generation. It has a default Fetch API in Next that caches the response. Here's an example of how to use Static Data Fetching:

```
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://myapi.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}
```

### Dynamic Data Fetching

Next.JS can be used with the "cache - no-store" option on the Fetch API for dynamic data fetching. Here's an example of how to use Dynamic Data Fetching:

```
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://myapi.com/data', {
    cache: 'no-store',
  });
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}
```

In conclusion, Next.JS provides a number of powerful features that make it an ideal choice for building enterprise applications with React. Understanding the fundamentals of Next.JS is essential for any developer looking to leverage its power.
